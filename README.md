# My First Java GUI Project


My First Java GUI Project
Welcome to my first Java project where I've created a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) in Java.

# Description

This project serves as my introduction to GUI development in Java. I've utilized the AWT library to create a basic graphical interface with a frame.





## Features

- Frame Creation: Utilized AWT's Frame class to create the main window.
- GUI Elements: Experimented with various AWT components like buttons, text fields, labels, etc.
- Event Handling: Implemented event handling mechanisms to respond to user interactions with the GUI components.
- Simple Interactions: Created basic interactions such as button clicks, text field input, etc

# USAGE

- Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

- Clone: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
   https://github.com/parthptl07/Pmpatel.git
```

- Compile: Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files.

```bash
javac Main.java
```

- Run: Execute the compiled Java program.

```bash
java Main
```

- Interact: Once the program is running, interact with the GUI components as desired.
